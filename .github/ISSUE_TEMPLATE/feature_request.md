Remember that the mission of a Kubernetes operator is to translate human operational knowledge into code. That includes but is not restricted to install, clean up, configurations, backups/restores, take care of high availability, collect metrics, calculate insights based on metrics, take actions based on alerts or behaviors.

If you think you have a required task that needs to be done before NSM installation or during NSM usage that could be automated and watched by an operator then you're in the right place!
